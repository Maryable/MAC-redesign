# MAC-redesign 
MAC cosmetics website redesign
#This is redesign website of Mac cosmetics !
I designed all pages I coded and slide images using Figma.

###Main page
1. main slide indicates new promotions as	an appreciation event or seasonal events.
2. Used jQuery on Best seller tab 
3. Used slick slider for New collection slider and added dimmed <div> to cover both sides. To make the main slide clear in the middle, it was adjusted to 1,200 pixels.
4. Promotion area - Its own promotions need to be seen clearly.
5. Review event is essential for purchasing. it's needed to be seen organized. 

###Best seller page 
Existing websites are divided into bestsellers and must-have items. 
Rather, I wanted to distinguish the most popular products by type and color. 
Usually, we look for trend colors first when purchasing, 
so I highlighted the colors, and in the last section, I displayed seasonal set products and discount products. 
It is designed to go to the appropriate section when you click on the product types "Lip", "eye", and "Set" in the navigation bar.

###Cart 
When you hover your mouse over the shopping cart icon in the upper right corner, 
you can see the product in the shopping cart, 
and click the "View Cart" button or the shopping cart icon to go to the shopping cart page.

###New Collection 
The current website has designed a new collection list that fills the entire screen of the page, 
but I left a space on this page to make it look wide-open.
In addition, I created buttons that allows you to preview new products or move them to the collection by mouse hovering on the list. 
I used transfrom to give a flip effect.

###Lipstic product detail page 
I have placed the virtual try on button under the thumbnail 
so that you can see the lipstick color in advance using the device you have. 
If you click the lipstick color, you can see the product, and the lipstick name is changed to that color.
Underneath the product, I made a section where you could watch videos advertising the product, and I put the details of the product on the bottom of the page.
